description: '" ... A gripping and poignant novel of psychic possession. The story
  begins when Arthur Lawford awakes from sleeping on the tomb of an eighteenth-century
  pirate, Nicholas Sabathier, to find that his face has become entirely different.
  Indeed, it bears an uncanny resemblance to a woodcut portrait of Sabathier in an
  old French book. At first, Lawford feels exactly himself; but a little later he
  senses "that other feebly struggling personality ... beginning to insinuate itself
  into his consciousness." Is it possible for the spirit of a dead person, in its
  implacable will to continue its existence, to seize upon the living?"--Back cover.'
